# Flappy Bird Clone Browser Game

![Flappy Bird Logo](https://dotgears.com/img/flappybird_original_icon_256.png)

This project is a personal modification of the Flappy Bird browser-based game. The original mobile game by Dong Nguyen was removed from app stores, and this reimplementation allows it to be played in a browser. I made this clone specifically to improve the look of the game when added to a mobile home screen.

## Motivation

When adding the original game to the home screen on mobile, it lacked a proper favicon, resulting in a dull, generic browser icon. I wanted to bring back a little of the original *Flappy Bird* nostalgia with a proper icon, so I added a favicon to this version.
